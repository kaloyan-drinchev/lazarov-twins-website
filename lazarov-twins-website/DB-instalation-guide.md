Important Settings During Installation:
CRITICAL: Remember your password!
The installer will ask for a password for the "postgres" superuser
Write this password down - you'll need it later!
After Installation:
The installer will also install:
✅ pgAdmin (graphical database manager)
✅ Command line tools
✅ Stack Builder (optional components)
Try the installation first, then let me know:
✅ "Installation completed successfully"
✅ "I wrote down my postgres password"
❓ Any error messages you encountered
Once you confirm the installation worked, we'll move to Step 2: Setting up your first database!
Questions before we continue:
Did the installation complete without errors?
Do you have your postgres password written down safely?
